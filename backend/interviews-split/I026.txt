受访人 26:
Unknown Speaker
Like store then also, I also just started on my own,

Unknown Speaker
sorry, store,

Unknown Speaker
FB as well. Yeah,

Speaker 1
I think I lost you for a little bit. It's that means store for E commerce or something,

Unknown Speaker
yeah.

Speaker 1
So which kind of E commerce? Which region are you trying to reach out?

Unknown Speaker
Oh, currently, I'm I'm in Malaysia, yeah.

Speaker 1
And you are doing the business between Malaysia and Singapore, yes, okay, that is cool, actually. So what when you start using AI in your work or your entrepreneur projects,

Speaker 2
I think it's more of the marketing side when I need to do journey post, some Instagram posts and stuff. So use AI, or sometimes you generate some ideas, I'll use it as well. Yeah,

Speaker 1
so do you have a team, or you just do all the marketing stuff yourself? Yeah, myself. So what, which kind of, for example, the if you want to launch a campaign like, how much of the workflow you're gonna generate by AI,

Unknown Speaker
I will say, I hate.

Speaker 2
I always started my workflow by AI, yeah. Then from there, I Google right here and there, a bit, but mostly all my, you know, Instagram posts and stuff, or by AI.

Speaker 1
So do you think AI gave you a guideline or something in this portion, in this process?

Speaker 2
Yes, a guideline, and yeah, a guideline and a very detailed workflow

Speaker 1
after it gives you the guideline, would you to optimize something, or you just directly, using that

Unknown Speaker
depends I was, depends on what

Speaker 2
it gave me. Because sometimes I don't really like the idea that the AI, K, so I will try to optimize a bit, but sometimes, if I'm happy with the result, I will just use it directly.

Speaker 1
Also, which kind of model you are frequently using,

Unknown Speaker
mostly,

Speaker 2
I would say, optimize, optimize.

Speaker 1
Okay, so is that the framework or yes, okay, okay. So, for example, because I used to doing marketing, if you are trying to make a a copyright, okay, or you're just just trying to make a copy for the post. So how much you gonna rely on AI and how much you're gonna to rely on your own creativity?

Speaker 2
Mainly, if I'm reading an Instagram post, normally on photos, I'll shoot by myself, like I'll be by myself, then I'll feed the AI what the photo shows and what kind of like emotions I want to evoke in that post, or what kind of information I want to give in that particular book, yeah, then AI will generate the captions. So,

Speaker 1
okay, so do you feel like the AI generated really help you to get the flow, or help you to get the data that you are expected.

Unknown Speaker
Yes, I think it helped me a lot.

Speaker 2
Sorry, you gave me two options, right? But I couldn't really understand

Speaker 1
well, it means if you have a goal for each task. Do you think? Do you think AI can help you to to reach that? And how much you feel like it's gonna help you?

Speaker 2
I think it can actually easily help around 70, 80%

Speaker 1
so, so how did you like? Break it down the work.

Unknown Speaker
Break it down the work.

Speaker 2
Okay, maybe, for example, I want to start make a marketing campaign. So I'll give them, ask them to help me generate some guideline ideas first, so I optimize it. So, you know, they will, sometimes they'll give me a very detailed every, every single step. But even under the every single step, I will still ask the AI to help me generate even more detailed steps with that particular step. Yeah,

Speaker 1
so how can you just feel the tutorial that the air has already give to you is the accurate one.

Speaker 2
I don't know if it's giving me the I think sometimes what I do is I will go and press check online, but most of the time it mostly is like, what the internet okay, what the internet give me? Yeah? Well, for me, it's more of the trial and error. This is a very marketing base. So there's not really a right and wrong answer for you,

Speaker 1
but have you ever tried to verify it? Maybe by the other different kind of AI models or something?

Speaker 2
Not really, because so far, I think it's all been quite okay.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, okay, so, like,

Speaker 1
how much of the parts you feel like aI doing the best,

Unknown Speaker
the pose, the

Unknown Speaker
parts, the parts, the part. Oh, the parts, okay. I think the

Unknown Speaker
best is still giving me a

Unknown Speaker
general guideline, yeah,

Speaker 1
still light. Like to make AI to be your consultant or your Yes, yes. It kind of tutor to help you to have a better understanding in each of the task, if you start going out and it's got just give you a inspiration to get started, right? If I understand, yes. So okay, thank you. So if you trying to do this, you alone with AI and you have no team together. So which do you think is the best way to deal this kind of collaboration, like, how do you identify the boundaries of AI's capabilities?

Speaker 2
Probably, I, personally, I don't see there's any boundaries between this cooperation method. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So do you feel like maybe the thing is generated is too, like, AI style or something?

Speaker 2
I think the caption, yes, sometimes I think for AI, like, for instance, chatgpt, normally, when I asked to write, you know, the post itself, normally it's too weak, sometimes a bit too rigid and too false. You know, they have the really long and dash, which normally, most people don't use and dash. So, yeah, I think maybe yeah, that is one of the limitation I would say.

Unknown Speaker
How could you deal with this kind of problem?

Speaker 2
I will replace everything like that particular statement, for instance.

Speaker 1
So how can you just, like, figure out which kind of is is to AI, and which kind of the things that is generated is you feel like it's okay. Therapy can be used,

Speaker 2
I think, is from reading the like, if you read many articles and posts and stuff like, you'll kind of just get it ahead of it, like it's genuine the way you fight it, yeah, and stuff like that. Make it more personal, I guess.

Speaker 1
So it's mostly both on your own experience, right? So, yeah, okay, so I just have a question, is about if you trying to get connection with AI, just you and AI itself. So do you ever ask AI to act as a role, or something like, if we as a reviewer, a a marketer, a audience of of your target, anything this kind of

Unknown Speaker
Yes. I

Speaker 2
sometimes do ask them to be another role, yes.

Speaker 1
So do you think is, can directly identify which kind of role to present different kind of the content, right?

Unknown Speaker
I think

Unknown Speaker
for this, I maybe

Speaker 2
I when I use role, right? It's not only for my marketing, but mostly for, like, my interview process. Yeah. So I will give the AIP AI a road the background of the particular interviewer, and they will kind of generate what kind of potential question they will ask or like stuff around it. And I think it's pretty accurate so far.

Speaker 1
But, like, however, if the interview like you between me that I actually have a blur background of yourself, so can kind of just accurate to output that well, and then you should how, like, how to instruct it, um,

Speaker 2
I think all my interviews are face to face, so that is not applicable to me.

Speaker 1
So for example, we if you have an interview right now, how can you to make AI to better understand your audience, like which kind of the information you're gonna give it to

Speaker 3
him. I think it's mainly based on the kind

Speaker 2
of the background, the particular career background of the interviewer, and the particular job role, job description of the rule they have applied.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, that kind of information,

Speaker 1
and it's gonna give you the progress that is you It thinks you're gonna be better to getting on the progress of the interview. So, yeah, so if you started to to to review the content is generated you cannot directly use, or you just review and optimize yourself.

Unknown Speaker
Review and optimize.

Speaker 1
So based on the content that AI generated, you think which part is the thing need to optimize?

Unknown Speaker
I think it's the way

Unknown Speaker
they phrase particular like introduction.

Speaker 2
Maybe it's sometimes too generalized or sometimes too rigid, yeah. So I will try to optimize by, you know, rephrasing the whole introduction, but, you know, keeping the main point that AI asked me to point it out and stuff like that.

Speaker 1
So were you to require AI to provide the references these sources or something

Unknown Speaker
not really

Speaker 1
the How can you verify the correctness of AI?

Speaker 2
Because this is like my experience. Do you know that I need to fit AI my own resume? I don't understand the question.

Speaker 1
It's about if you just rely on AI on the output of your work. How can you verify the correctness of AI's output if you don't require the relevant sources just recording on the correct the corresponding outputs that directly give it to you?

Speaker 2
Just to clarify that you are referring to that, do I need? Do I give AI certain information for them to, you

Unknown Speaker
know, come with the output,

Unknown Speaker
okay, yeah. I mean, I do give

Unknown Speaker
AI, you know,

Unknown Speaker
my resume and my background

Speaker 2
to ask them, help me generate an introduction, like, based on my strengths and weaknesses, experience

Unknown Speaker
to highlight based on

Unknown Speaker
that particular job description. Yeah.

Speaker 1
So like you are, like, how much you you trust in AI, after you give you the information and the things that is already up to you,

Speaker 2
I will say, I'll give it like 70% I'll trust it 70% like whatever I mentioned that 30% is really sometimes it's the way it phrase is. It's just not. I just think that's not personal right now. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker
so how can you deal with the 30%

Unknown Speaker
I will

Unknown Speaker
rephrase on my own,

Unknown Speaker
without the eye.

Speaker 1
Could you please just give me a scenario like one of your your working campaign, or one of your content output?

Unknown Speaker
Okay, for, for instance, when

Speaker 2
I want to write a particular Instagram post itself, it will, it will kind of give a very rigid bones. For example, a big day ahead. Today is a big day. We are pushing out a certain product and stuff like that, with a lot of on dash, with little explanation of that particular product. But for me, this is very rigid in a way. So I will we raise the whole thing and make it into,

Unknown Speaker
like a more personal story, like, you know,

Speaker 2
this, our company, how we started, and we are pushing out this brand, instead of making it into a very point, point form, like and make it your story.

Speaker 1
Okay, so if you optimize the content, will you give it back to AI to let him to check or something? Normally No, normally no, you just directly to Yes, yep. Okay. So in the entrepreneur scenario, you only use these kind of tools in the content output. Or do you ever use it to any like business development or something?

Unknown Speaker
I will use it to find particular

Unknown Speaker
product source as well.

Speaker 2
Yeah. For instance, last night, I was trying to find different brands

Unknown Speaker
in

Speaker 2
particular footprints that is being produced by a certain brand, or I'm looking for a certain product that's only produced by a few brands. Then I need more information about that. Then I think AI can pretty generate all the information I need instead of me, you know, going down to the Support Market, check it on my own.

Speaker 1
Okay, so have you ever feel the AI's uncertain effect your trust?

Speaker 2
I uh, it affect my trust in what

Speaker 1
in the process of your no matter, looking for the other partners, for the other like the you have imagined about the supply chain, for the products or anything, do you feel like the uncertain things maybe to affect your trust to the this kind of target audience.

Speaker 2
I I think I'm I'm not. I still quite, I don't really have this trust issue. Yeah. Sorry. Okay,

Speaker 1
so have you ever to face the financing kind of deal with this tools by using AI.

Unknown Speaker
No, well, finance, I don't use AI,

Speaker 1
okay, so you think all the marketing issues that you have already have in your business can be deal with AI, just you with it. There's no need for the team, right for for now?

Unknown Speaker
Yes,

Speaker 1
so since you adopt these tools, like, how has you decision making, quality and the kind of efficiency or thinking style be changed.

Speaker 2
Clarify. You're talking about how AI can affect my efficiency in work.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, okay,

Speaker 2
I think AI really increased my efficiency of work, yeah, by a lot. Yeah, and it kind of save our manpower course as well.

Speaker 1
So how is it's gonna to influence your decision making,

Speaker 2
in decision making in terms of like, what decision making, or what kind of decision

Unknown Speaker
making, no matter for the

Speaker 1
content decision, or for the the target audience decision, the creativity decision, the branding decision, this kind of decision, if you rely on AI will, how has it the serial quality gonna be be influenced.

Speaker 2
I think currently, my decision making is really, I would say, heavily dependent on AI.

Speaker 1
And yes, just, could you play a little bit they probably like before you, before AI generated. This Euro comes, what is kind of your decision making, like, your logic and after AI, what is your decision making? Quality changed?

Speaker 2
Okay? Maybe, for instance, back then, when I want to create a marketing campaign and stuff like that, right? It took me, like, hours to look online to see what's the viral post like, and stuff like this. But I think currently, AI can give me a very, very good like, you know, the bone, the structure of the post itself, and all I need to do is, like, pick it here and there. And I can, you know, that particular pose can be done within like, like, three minutes, max.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, so this is the efficiency part.

Speaker 2
And for the rest back then, I think I hate, I rely heavily on my friends and family, I'll ask them, you know, what, what they feel about a particular pose, how, what kind of emotion you will evolve this kind of thing. But, yeah, now it's just me and the eye. So,

Speaker 1
okay, so how do you avoid over like, rely on it.

Unknown Speaker
I I,

Unknown Speaker
actually, I, I guess I

Speaker 2
don't have a clear boundary of what is over relying. Because I know I now rely heavily on AI, but what I can do is I will not, you know, 100% trust what the response AI give me instead of No, sometimes I'll still ask around to, you know, contract the particular information, yeah, and stuff like that.

Speaker 1
So you just started to using AI when you started your business, right?

Unknown Speaker
Yes.

Speaker 1
Okay, so do you feel maybe some improvements would you like to see in AI a better support your career?

Speaker 2
I guess it's the same old thing. I think the way it kind of bright sometimes it's not really. It's still too rigid and not set personal enough in putting in a particular context.

Speaker 1
Do you think is is somehow to influence your critical thinking?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, definitely.

Unknown Speaker
So if you have the the

Speaker 1
chance to redesign the system, do you think which kind of the instructions or which can of the tools to plug in, maybe to deal with this kind of problem, to let people to have a better, better way to thinking this way,

Speaker 2
it's like what I will do differently for AI to make sure that it can evoke critical thinking in us. Yes,

Unknown Speaker
I guess it

Speaker 2
is, instead of giving a very detailed answer, instead is they can actually kind of ask me back, what do I think, or what do I feel, giving me open ended question instead of like, you know, detailed response.

Speaker 1
Have you ever like question it about how it generated. Like, what, how, what is the progress is generated?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, I'll be curious about it.

Speaker 1
Okay, so have you ever questioned about it, like, what is the result is already generated? Like, um, why you generate this kind of content? To me, um, uh,

Unknown Speaker
I don't I.

Unknown Speaker
Why do we generate this kind of content?

Speaker 2
So far, I think I'm still, I don't have that kind of curiosity, because most of my questions are very factual.

Speaker 1
Okay, yeah, so is there any data using by AI,

Unknown Speaker
data using

Speaker 1
like the platform management, the dashboards, the the Google Trends, this kind of thing, gonna rely

Unknown Speaker
on AI. I'm not very sure about what you said.

Speaker 1
Like, if you doing the mock analysis right, you should deal with the easy platform dashboard. So if you to deal with this data. Do you use AI to help you to analyze it normally? No, okay, you are only focusing on the content domain or marketing, okay? So if you ever feel like the the AI in one or two years, gonna play essential roles for every one who wanted to start up in this, in this area.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, can we be like, I

Speaker 1
currently like, do you see the AI is a tool? Because I feel like you are totally like, collaborate with AI, like he is one of your partner here. Yeah. So AI is a role. Do you feel like involving in the EC business era in the next one or two years gonna be more and more and more essential?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, definitely.

Speaker 1
So how do you think people gonna to revise the AI collaboration, this kind of thing to if you can write and like aI collaboration guide for the for the new startup, for the new entrepreneurship in the E commerce, which key things would you like to highlight?

Unknown Speaker
Maybe the, maybe some copyright issue,

Unknown Speaker
like, for instance, if, if I ask

Speaker 2
AI to generate a particular idea, I mean, I feel it, of course, some of the basic idea that I have right now that it kind of helped me to optimize that basic idea. Maybe, you know, that will be, I can just, you know, tell AI not to, you know, give this kind of information to other user, since it's, I don't know, you can send me a copyright for that particular idea. Yeah.

Speaker 1
Oh, the copyright usually is really important. So how can you just make sure the copyright the AI generate for you is is like, unique and can be useful?

Speaker 2
Yeah? So I think, I think that's, that's why I am if you are talking about in the future, if everybody start using AI in this right? I think copyright issue is one of our biggest concern.

Speaker 1
So right now, have you ever tried to deal with this kind of issue?

Speaker 2
No, currently, no like, that's why sometimes I will keep the most of the ideas of myself, yeah, and give it like a non sensitive information, for instance.

Speaker 1
So have you ever, like be be troubled with that?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, actually, yes.

Speaker 1
Like, which kind of the output or container names give to you to let you through into some of the issues.

Unknown Speaker
Um, we are still on the page, on the copyright issue, right?

Speaker 2
Okay, so for me is I feel very troubled you sometimes. I hope I also, I do wish that, you know, I can be AI, like information, like some ideas that I have,

Unknown Speaker
and it can help me optimize. But

Speaker 2
my biggest fear is really just about, you know, my ideas, or the ideas that I share with AI might be, you know, share with other people. And yeah, it's all about the timing.

Speaker 1
Is there any experience situation where the AI, otherwise like contradict your your intra intuitions, the AI and my might just turn out to be right or wrong. Sorry, can't repeat your question. Like, if the if somehow you feel like, oh, the AI advice is totally like contradicted to your intuition. So and

Unknown Speaker
have you ever this kind of experience?

Unknown Speaker
Early, no, no,

Speaker 1
okay, so sort of think AI is seems too smart, or you feel maybe you know, in some ways it's gonna to miss these in your task.

Speaker 2
I do, I think, yeah, AI is very smart and and, sorry, what? So I can't really understand the second part,

Speaker 1
like it's just lead you to a wrong direction.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, okay. Hey, me too. Okay.

Speaker 2
Currently, the direction wise, I am still not so I haven't dwell into it so much that I can give information about that.

Speaker 1
Okay, so maybe it's just give you an analysis that look logical, but you you might just just bought it off law. And have you ever had this kind of experience before? No, no, no. So how did you decide to fully trust AI? And want to double check

Unknown Speaker
when I want to fully trust AI,

Unknown Speaker
when it's a very factual thing, I would say,

Speaker 2
like, for instance, I asked, How old is Singapore this year? I will fully trust AI. But if I'm talking about

Unknown Speaker
finding

Speaker 2
company specializing in a certain Yeah, or wherever, can I find my source company for my product? Yeah, that one I won't trust 100% I still need you based on my own experience and my connections.

Speaker 1
So do you have a like checklist for verification

Unknown Speaker
checklist. I don't

Speaker 2
really have a checklist, but what I can, I guess, for me, if I will go back to Google itself and try to check all the reviews and stuff and ask people around me about their opinions on that particular company, particular brand, particular products, yeah.

Speaker 1
So what if it just gives you an ambiguous answer? How do you like critically to interpret it?

Speaker 2
If it gave me a very big answer, normally, I'll just do research on my own.

Speaker 1
Okay, okay, so how could you to do the research progress to rely on your your searching tools, or using another AI or something

Unknown Speaker
I normally eat,

Speaker 2
I would just ask people around me based on my your like connections, human connections, company connections, yeah, I think that's the most accurate information.

Speaker 1
Okay, so have you ever tried to like this? If you want AI to present a plan like for certain strategy, that's that you have already output you have you ever tried to do like a, a, b test to plan A, and it's just to give you A Plan B and to make a comparation. Yes.

Speaker 2
Um. Uh, A, B, man, maybe is the way I maybe I'll go back to the easiest, like Instagram posts.

Unknown Speaker
Yeah, so sometimes I will try to

Unknown Speaker
ask AI to write the pose,

Unknown Speaker
you know, in a more

Speaker 2
kind of style that I want to achieve, different style they want to achieve, and see how people react to different style.

Unknown Speaker
Like, you know the output,

Speaker 1
how do you feel like the AI output just corresponding that you have already expected to the like, different style for the audience, their feedback?

Speaker 2
I think, in a way, for me, this is a more creativity thing, so I wouldn't say there's a definitely

Unknown Speaker
like correct or wrong answer, yeah.

Speaker 1
So for you, you know, there has so much of the professional copywriters professional career, it has to doing this kind of job. Do you think they're gonna like gradually to lost their job because of AI? Yes. Why? Social? So what is the difference between you? You feel like AI is between to from the the professional copywriters of professional creators.

Speaker 2
I think their role is definitely still relevant for now, in a way. However,

Unknown Speaker
I guess in the

Speaker 2
future, if it's being trained so well that they can really accommodate to know my style of writing and stuff like that. I think it's very tough, because now I will still, sometimes I'll still ask my copywriter friend to help me read through the Instagram post, and they'll give him some input about that,

Speaker 1
because I feel like before, we are trying to understand marketing, trying to understand the case studies, and we often to see some of the web papers from default advertisement. And the reason why they are not that concerned about copyright, because everything comes from the inspiration from the sense of the creators. And I think that is a thing which AI kind of lost. So how can you deal with this kind of problem, if you trying to make your content more sensible, more with some of the web Do you think I can help you to reach that out?

Speaker 2
Apparently, I don't think can do such thing yet, so I will still, yeah, that's why I think optimization still need to be done by humans itself.

Speaker 1
Okay, so you feel like this, this gonna do two parts to to output on AI, right? Yes. One is, can rely on people on their senses, and the other thing the AI supporter to give them instruction of where to go, right? Yes. Okay, so do you think maybe it's just encourage the people who is involved in this kind of air area to maybe think less or do less,

Unknown Speaker
think late and do less. I think it actually

Speaker 2
increase the efficiency rate with the like, kind of like AI can already give you, you know, save you a lot of time beforehand, so you can actually have more time, you know, derive more creativity, instead of, you know, blogging and like, research and stuff like that.

Speaker 1
That is means that I, if I understand right, if you just doing this thing in this healthy way, which means that you have already let your AI generated content really helpful to you, right? That, yes, like, how much percentage of the content it gives to you to support your business, to running through this smoothie? Yes, like, like, how much the percentage? Maybe.

Unknown Speaker
Okay, so,

Speaker 1
so, what is the risky you feel? Like, most concerned about yourself, like, if you just said about the copyrights, and do you have any others, like the securities, like the bias, these kind of things,

Speaker 2
my my insecurities in using AI in my

Speaker 1
situation, yes. And the things you concern the most,

Speaker 2
I guess, is really about speeding is sensitive information, and the sensitive information will be linked to other people.

Speaker 1
Okay? And how could you deal with the bias problems in the the process that you trying to to deal with the information that give it to you, like, like, the gender bias, or this kind of things may be already, like, resisted in this the era for long and How could you deal with this kind of bias? Currently, I haven't thought about it yet. Okay, so

Unknown Speaker
if you trying to say that

Speaker 1
the copywriter, the curator, the this kind of creativity, jobs gonna to just gradually be, be, be lost because of AI. So do you think ever the the concern about the how much homogenization, one where the the everyone use AI and strategies look alike?

Unknown Speaker
Yes, I think that's one of the concern.

Speaker 1
So how could you feel like it's gonna to be deal in the future? And how can you feel like a is is maybe have a way or tools or a better design for the product to help this kind of issue to be deal with.

Speaker 2
Then maybe, okay, maybe I won't take back my words. We still need humans to, you know, creativity.

Speaker 1
So here. So do you feel like after this so much of questions, can you just summarize your creative thinking in the whole progress of your Collaborate with AI and which kind of the things that you feel like maybe can optimize to help you to better creative and help you to make him more human being.

Unknown Speaker
I think you

Unknown Speaker
wait. Let me bring my thoughts together.

Unknown Speaker
It's okay, just take your time. I do

Speaker 2
you mind repeating the question again? I want to make sure I didn't miss out.

Speaker 1
Okay, so, because we have already discussion about the progress of your elaborate with AI, right? So, and you change your mind that you feel like, okay, human being really essential. So, but like, gradually, I feel like I have the same concern about you, like the creative drop gonna be instead of AI. But I think the thing is, really need to optimize because of AI cannot generate any relevant things that you want have, like the sense, the odds, the other webs that you want to have. So which kind of tools, if you are like a product manager here, or which kind of like instructions you might feel can output to deal with this kind of problem.

Speaker 2
I guess is, if I want to deal with I want AI to generate a particular style with what I will do is I'll feed it like all the pictures, all the captions that I like to AI to us, AI to you know, generate the kind of

Speaker 1
stuff you mean to personalize, yes, the information that I feed. So which we can you to be more like deep into the personalized here, which you mean,

Unknown Speaker
okay, for instance,

Speaker 2
Well, recently there's the studio guilty Wu ha about that. So maybe, if I want my particular, you know, art work to have that, I will, you know, feed it like all the photos from Studio Ghibli, and say a very similar artwork. That's why I, you know, the artwork will be more personalized to what I want to my demand,

Unknown Speaker
if we come into the

Speaker 1
customer journey, okay, now you are trying to to do a case, starting with AI, and you give you try to chat with it, with GPT, and just visualize, realize your your your expectations. Could you please? Maybe you How can need to help you to more personalized

Speaker 2
in you mean from a customer journey like, Sorry, can repeat,

Speaker 1
the customer journey is between you and AI. You is AI's customer, and now you are giving him it a case, and you gave it instructions. You talk to it, and you want it to be more personalized. So which you do think maybe realization, the the whole journey is just to be more personalized. Okay,

Speaker 2
okay, maybe for me, it's like if I were to write a post that will be targeted to Singaporeans, for instance, maybe I will. I'll feed it like, you know, how Singapore or the KOLs, how they describe their pose, how how did they talk? How did it relate to, you know, Singapore audience, the way they speak, the way they write. I guess I will. I will, you know us AI to write the same kind of style. For example, it's English. If I want to make it even more personal, I prefer you know that particular statement have a lot of Singlish, but being professional enough, then I will ask it to refer to locate, how, how Singapore The mostly killers. How did it? Yeah,

Speaker 1
